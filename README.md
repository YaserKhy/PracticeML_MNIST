# Welcome !
In this notebook, we will build a model to predict handwritten digit images from the famous `mnist` dataset using `tensorflow` library.

The notebook has 3 sections
- Data Processing : where we load the dataset and explore it.
- Model Building : where we build our neural network model.
- Model Evaluation : where we see the model performance on unseen data.
